# Frontend Test Environment

This is the folder used for testing our frontend.
This folder contains **only the test files**, the tools and dependencies are declared on the overall frontend repository and as such this folder should not have a `package.json` or anything similar.
As such, please refer to the Frontend `package.json` for any dependencies you might want, as well as setting up the necessary commands for the tests to run.
